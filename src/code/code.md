# Code

Here is a collection of page about programming languages, frameworks and other coding tools. It's a mix between resources and cheatsheets.

## Languages categories

### Programming languages

- Programming languages are:
	- a set of instructions
	- written in human-readable form
	- *compiled* in machine-level language (assembly, binary, etc).
- It's usually fast and efficient, but need to be compiled again for each code update.
- **Analogy**: you need to bake a pizza from an italian recipe. Someone give you a translated version.
- **Examples**: Java, C, C++, C#

#### Scripting languages

- Scripting languages are *interpreted* instead of *compiled*
- **Analogy**: you need to bake a pizza from an italian recipe. Someone sits next to you and give you the instructions.
- **Examples**: Javascript, PHP, [Python](languages/python.md), Perl

### Markup languages

- Markup languages are used to present and describe in a structural way.
- Don't contain logics or algorithm.
- Usually used in [web](../engineering/infrastructure/web/web.md).
- **Analogy**: you just baked a pizza and need to write the menu.
- **Examples**: HTML, CSS, XML
