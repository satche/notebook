# Code

## Languages categories

### Programming languages

- Programming languages are:
	- a set of instructions
	- written in human-readable form
	- *compiled* in machine-level language (assembly, binary, etc).
- It's usually fast and efficient, but it need to be compiled each time a developer update the code.
- **Analogy**: you need to bake a pizza from an italian recipe. Someone give you a translated version. If the recipe change, the interpreter needs to translate the new version before giving it to you.
- **Examples**: Java, C, C++, C#

#### Scripting languages

- Scripting languages are *interpreted* instead of *compiled*
- It's simple and execution is in real-time, but it's usually slower and less efficient than programming languages.
- **Analogy**: you need to bake a pizza from an italian recipe. Someone sits next to you and give you the instructions. The interpreters can adapt the recipe in real-time, but it's slower to tell you rather than you read it yourself.
- **Examples**: Javascript, PHP, [Python](languages/python.md), Perl

### Markup languages

- Markup languages are used to present and describe in a structural way.
- Don't contain logics or algorithm.
- Usually used in [web](../engineering/web/web.md).
- **Analogy**: the pizza is already baked, you just need to write the menu.
- **Examples**: HTML, [CSS](languages/css.md),XML

> [!NOTE]
> Compared to programming/scripting language, markup languages are *not* [Turing-complete](../engineering/infrastructure/turing-machine.md#Turing-complete).
