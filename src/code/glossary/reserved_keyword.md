# Reserved keyword

A [reserved keyword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_word) is a special name used in a programming langage that cannot be used as an [identifier](/code/glossary/identifier.md).

For example, in Python, `class` couldn't be used to name a variable, since it's a reserved keyword to define classes.
