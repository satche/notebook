# Anonymous Function

An [anonymous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function) is a function with no name. It's used as small, throwaway functions, usually in context of sorting, [closures](closure.md) and [currying](currying.md).
## Examples

```javascript
function (x,y) {
	return x*y
}
```
