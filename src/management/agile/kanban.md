# Kanban

[Kanban](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/kanban_(development)) is a simple scheduling system in project management.

Tasks (e.g [User Stories](../../index.md#user-story)) are written on cards that are placed in columns on a [board](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/kanban_board), which represent its current status.

Usually, three columns are used to keep track of the progress:
*To Do*, *In Progress*, *Completed*
