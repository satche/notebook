# Lean

[Lean](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/lean_software_development) is a project management methodology focusing on identifying and minimising waste to maximise value.

## Wastes

- **Overproduction**: Making more than needed, leading to inventory buildup.
- **Waiting**: Downtime, when people or machines arenâ€™t working.
- **Transport**: Unnecessary movement of products/materials.
- **Extra Processing**: Doing more work than the customer values.
- **Inventory**: Excess stock taking up space and cash.
- **Motion**: Unnecessary movements by workers, like reaching or walking.
- **Defects**: Errors requiring rework or scrapping.
