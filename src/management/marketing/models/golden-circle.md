# Golden Circle

[The golden circle](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/start_with_why#the_golden_circle) is a schema to define the purpose of an entreprise. It states that you should start with the center of the circle and move to the outside, not the opposite. 

- **Why**: define the philosophy, values, promises, purposes, what you believe in.
- **How**: define the marketing, the communications canals, what make it special.
- **What**: define the product and/or service you want to offer.
