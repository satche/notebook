## Hero's Journey

[Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) is a common template in stories about a main character who goes on a quest and return changed. Different versions exists, but they usually fit into 3 main acts:

1. **Departure**. The hero lives in the ordinary world and receives a call to go on an adventure. He is reluctant to follow the call but is helped by a mentor figure.
2. **Initiation**. The hero faces tasks or trials on his way, alone or with a party. He eventually reaches the central crisis of his adventure, which he needs to overcome to gain his reward.
3. **Return**. The hero returns to the initial place/situation. The hero is transformed by the adventure.
