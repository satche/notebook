# Stochastic

[Stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic) mean something random but within a predictable framework or pattern. In a stochastic system, randomness is within a controlled environment where probabilistic rules apply.

**Example**
- Random: roll a dice
- Stochastic: increase probability to roll a 6 on a dice depending on previous attempts
