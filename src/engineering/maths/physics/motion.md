# Motion

## Newton's laws

The three [Newton's laws of motion](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion):

### First law

> A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force.

- Define force and inertia
- A stationary object will only begin to move if there is an unbalanced force acting on it
- Moving object will only change speed or direction if there is an unbalanced force acting on it

**Examples**
- An object resting on the ground is influenced by the gravity and a reaction force (the ground). As the forces are balanced, the object is not moving.
- In outer space, where there is no "natural" forces (friction, air resistance, gravity), an object would keep on moving in a straight line.

### Second law

> When a body is acted upon by a force, the time rate of change of its momentum equals the force.

$$F=ma=m\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{dp}{dt}$$

- Net force: $F$
- Mass: $m$
- Acceleration: $a=\frac{dv}{dt}$ (see: [derivatives](../algebra/derivatives.md))
- Velocity: $v$
- Momentum: $p=mv$
- The momentum $p$ of an object is the product of its mass $m$ and velocity $v$

**Examples**
- The weight of an object is it's mass multiplied by gravity (~9.8m/sec. on Earth)

### Third law

> If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.
