# Vector

In math, a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)) has different "meaning" depending on the field it is used:

- **[Algebra](/engineering/maths/algebra/algebra.md)**: represents an object in a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space), where operations like addition and multiplication use [scalars](/engineering/maths/algebra/tensor/vector.md) and follow specific rules.
- **[Physics](/engineering/maths/physics/physics.md)**: an object that has a *magnitude* (i.e. size) and a *direction*. It's used to show the distance and direction something moved in, or to represent physical quantities like velocity, force, and acceleration.
- **Geometry**: used to describe points, directions, and displacements in space. It helps define geometric objects, transformations, and can be used to calculate distances, angles, and projections.
