# Scalar

[Scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)) are simple number we use to do mathematical operations (e.g. addition, multiplication, â€¦).

If we measure and do mathematical operation on length, mass, temperature or other units, it's done with scalars.

It's relevant to use the term "scalar" if we do operations on multi-dimensional [tensors](/engineering/maths/algebra/tensor/vector.md), like [vector](/engineering/maths/algebra/tensor/vector.md) or [matrix](/engineering/maths/algebra/tensor/vector.md), so multiplications can be done even if it's not the same dimension.

For example, a scalar $k$ (1 dimension) can multiply a vector $v$ (2 dimensions).
$$
k\times{v}=2\times[1,2,3]=[2,4,6]
$$
