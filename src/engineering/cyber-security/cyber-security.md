# Cyber security

In [Information Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security), we intend to protect information from a system.
In [Cyber security](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/computer_security), the system is a computer.

This chapter is split into 3 categories:
- **Principles**: frameworks, organisation and theoretical standards to apply security
- [**Threats**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_(computer_security)): who/what try to break in a system
- [**Defenses**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_controls): tactics used to enforce the security of a system.
