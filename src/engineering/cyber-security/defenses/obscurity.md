# Security through obscurity

[Security through obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) is the principle to hide and conceal informations related to a system to better protect it.

This approach should only be considered as a complement to other, more reliables, solutions. Security should *not* principally rely on obscurity principle.
