# Fault injection

[Fault injections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_injection) test a system by throwing errors at it and see how it behaves under failure conditions. It allows to test its resilience and find weak spots.

**Software-based** injections will find bugs in the code and corrupt memory.

**Hardware-based** injections will typically test the system by applying high voltages, extreme temperature, electromagnetic pulses on physical components, etc.
