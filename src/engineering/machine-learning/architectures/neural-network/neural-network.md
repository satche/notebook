# Neural Network

In [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), we use [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)) (ANN) as architecture to solve [Machine Learning](../../machine-learning.md) problems. An ANN imitates a brain by connecting [perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) (i.e. artificial neurons) together. 

## Architectures

- [Autoencoder](autoencoder.md): mainly used to discover and learn features from unlabeled data.
- [CNN](cnn.md): used in computer vision and image generation
- [Transformer](transformer.md): architecture made of 2 main parts, a *encoder* and a *decoder*
- [GAN](gan.md): 2 neural networks (generator and discriminator) compete against each other
