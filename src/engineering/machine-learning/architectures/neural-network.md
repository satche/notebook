# Neural Network

In [Deep_learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), we use an [Artificial Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)) (ANN) as architecture to solve [Machine Learning](machine-learning.md) problems. An ANN imitates a brain by connecting [perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) (i.e. artificial neurons) together.
