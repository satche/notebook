# Generative AI

In [Generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence), models create new data based on the underlying pattern from the training data. 

## Image generation

In image generation, we generally use [text-to-image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model) models to create new images from scratch. Sometime, text can be replaced by image as input. 

**Metrics**
- [Inception Score](/engineering/machine-learning/metrics/inception-score.md) – Less favored because of its limitations
