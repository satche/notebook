# Vision Transformer

A [Vision Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer) (ViT) is a [transformer](/engineering/machine-learning/neural-network/transformer.md) designed for Computer Vision, used as an alternative to traditional [CNNs](/engineering/machine-learning/neural-network/cnn.md). Its dispatches the image into vectorized patches rather than text to tokens.

- With a global self-attention system, a ViT is particulary useful to capture distant features and understand a broad context
