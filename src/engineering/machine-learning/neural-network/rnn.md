# Recurrent Neural Network

A [Recurrent Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNN) are mainly used to process sequential data (text, speech, time series, â€¦), where order of element is important. It has a *backpropagation* mechanism to feed the results back to the network.
