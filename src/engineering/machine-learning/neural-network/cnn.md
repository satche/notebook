# Convolutional Neural Network

A [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) is mainly used in [Computer Vision](/engineering/machine-learning/applications/computer-vision.md) and [generative](/engineering/machine-learning/applications/generative-ai.md) images.

In an image, the pixels are treated by blocks using a *kernel*. It's mainly used to capture image's features, like edges or textures
