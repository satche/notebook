# Learning paradigms

There is different strategies to train a model. Here is a summary:


| Name                                                                                               | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Supervised Learning](/engineering/machine-learning/learning-paradigms/supervised-learning.md)     | The model is trained on labeled data                                   |
| [Self-supervised Learning](/engineering/machine-learning/learning-paradigms/self-supervised.md)    | The model extracts labels itself from the data                         |
| [Unsupervised Learning](/engineering/machine-learning/learning-paradigms/unsupervised-learning.md) | The model tries to find patterns in unlabeld data                      |
| [Reinforcement Learning](/engineering/machine-learning/learning-paradigms/reinforment-learning.md) | Model improve itself to get closer from an objective (reward mechanic) |
