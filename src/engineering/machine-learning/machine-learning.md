# Machine Learning

[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is the ability of a program or machine to think and learn by itself.

## Artificial Intelligence

Machine Learning is used as a synonym of [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), but it is actually a subset of the latter. AI define a broader scope, where systems can simulate human intelligence without relaying on Machine Learning (e.g. chat agents, video game bots, …).

The definition of AI is so large that we tend to classify it into sub-categories

### Key events

- **1949**: Alan Turing already created the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) to evaluate a system's intelligence by having a user interact with it. If the user believes they are communicating with a human, the system passes the test.
- **1955**: [Logic Theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist) is consider the first AI program, build to perform automated reasoning.
- **2016**: [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) defeat the best human player of Go in 2016
- **2018**: [AlphaFold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold) is a model that can predict the 3D structure of a protein from an amino acid sequence using reinforcement learning. In 4 years, it has published about 200 million proteins 3D structure predictions vs. 100’000 after 50 years of research using traditional methods.

- The [ELIZA effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect) describe how people tend to attribute human traits to intelligent systems that have a textual interface (typically with [LLMs](application/nlp.md)). Because of that, users empathise with AI system, from being polite to building friendship with.
- The [dead Internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) is a conspiracy theory that state that the web (social media in particular) mainly consist of bots
