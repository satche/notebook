# Metrics

[Metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space) are used in machine learning to assess the quality of the output.

## Images

- [Inception Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception_score) (IS) measures the quality and diversity of images [generated](/engineering/machine-learning/applications/generative-ai.md) by AI, using [Inception-v3](/engineering/machine-learning/applications/computer-vision.md#Models) model.
- [Fr√©chet Inception Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_inception_distance) (FID), inspired by IS, compares the generated images with a set of real pictures ("ground truth")
