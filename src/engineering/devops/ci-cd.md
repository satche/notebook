# CI/CD

[CI/CD](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ci/cd) stands for [continuous integration](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/continuous_integration) and [continuous delivery](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/continuous_delivery), sometimes [continuous deployment](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/continuous_deployment). It focus on the automatisation in building, testing and deployment of applications.

## Continuous Integration

- Protect `main` branch: keep it clean and production-ready at any time
- Automated checks run for every change
- Changes should stay small to lower risk and reduce debugging complexity

## Continuous Deployment

Automate build, test and deployment to different environments (staging, testing, production, etc.)

## Tests

[Testing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/software_testing) is to verify how a system works under different conditions.
