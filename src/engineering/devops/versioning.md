# Versioning

[Versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) is a way to name different versions of a software, allowing to keep track of the changes and updates over time.

A good naming convention is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- `MAJOR` versions have groundbreaking changes that often make it incompatible with previous version.
- `MINOR` versions add features that are backward compatible with previous versions.
- `PATCH` versions often include bug fixes, also backward compatible.

Some point to keep in mind:

- Major versions start at 0, usually in a development/beta/unstable phase (e.g. `0.y.z`)
