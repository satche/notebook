# Conway's law

[Conway's law](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/conway's_law) is a rule of thumb that states:

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

It means that a disparate team will tend to create a modular system. We can constat this tendency in open source software.

On the contrary, a "condensed" team will tend to create monolithic software. We can see this tendency in priority software.

We can try to inverse this effect by define architecture first and then structure the team which will develop it.
