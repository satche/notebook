# GPU

A [Graphics Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) (GPU) is responsible to display images, animations and other graphics element on screen.

## Main components

### Cores

- **RT cores**: Enable real-time ray tracing; more cores = better ray tracing performance.
- **L1/L2 cache**: Reduce latency by storing frequently accessed data closer to the cores.
- **CUDA cores**: Handle parallel tasks; more cores = more simultaneous operations.
- **Tensor cores**: NVIDIA's specialized units for efficient matrix calculations, crucial for AI workloads.

### Performance Metrics

- **VRAM**: Video RAM; short-term memory for graphical data. More VRAM = handle larger/more complex images faster.
- **Memory bandwidth**: Speed at which data is read from or written to VRAM; higher bandwidth = faster data processing.
- **TFLOPS** (Tera Floating Point Operations Per Second): Measure of GPU's computational performance.
