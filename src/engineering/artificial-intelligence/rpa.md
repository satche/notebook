# Robotic Process Automation

[Robotic Process Automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation#) (RPA) is the principle to automate tasks with software bots/agents, possibly with the help of artificial intelligence.

- It's especially used to automate repetitive time-consuming tasks, allowing to increase productivity while mitigate human error
- The agents are not supposed to learn from the workflow, but some of them can be use AI for certain tasks (e.g. image recognition, etc)

## Examples and use cases

- A RPA system can receive and analysis the content of a customer's mail with an AI agent. The mail is classified and attributed to an employee. A draft of the response is suggested with a third generative AI agent.
