# Heap

[Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) are like [tree](../tree.md) data structures that satisfies the *heap property*. It means it's easier to do operations on the lowest/highest values.

There is 2 types of heaps:
- In a max-heap, the root node has the *maximum* value. The lowest node has the lowest values.
- In a min-heap, the root node has the *minimum* value. The lowest node has the highest values.

## Variants

There is many variants on the data structure implementation of heaps. You'll find some of them below, but don't hesitate to have a look at the [complete list]([complete list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)#Variants).

### Binary heap

A [binary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap) is structured like a [binary tree](../tree.md#Binary%20tree): each item within the tree has at most two children.
