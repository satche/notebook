# Bellman-Ford algorithm

[Bellman-Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm) algorithm find [shortest-path](../problems/shortest-path.md) in a [graph](/engineering/algorithms/graph/graph.md), from one vertex to the other ones. It's like [Dijkstra](dijkstra.md) algorithm, but can handle negative weighted edges. It's also slower.

## Complexity

[Time complexity](../complexity.md)
- **Worst-case**: $O(|V||E|)$
- **Best-case**: $\Omega(|E|)$
