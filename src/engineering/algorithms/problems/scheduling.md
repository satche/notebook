# Scheduling problems

[Scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)) involves some problems that can be fixed with [algorithms](../algorithms.md). Here is some scheduling problems:

## Optimal job-scheduling

In [optimal job-scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_job_scheduling) problem, we have a list of jobs (e.g. tasks, processes) and a list of machines (e.g. processors, workers). We need to assign jobs to machines so it's the most efficient in time.
