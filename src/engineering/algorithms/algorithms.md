# Algorithms

An [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) can be defined as a sequence of operations tailored to solve a specific problem.

We usually measure the performance of an algorithm by its [time complexity](complexity.md) during runtime.

## Terminology

- [Heuristic](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/heuristic_(computer_science)): give a quick solution for a specific problem, but it's usually not optimal
- [Metaheuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic): general heuristics methods that can be applied to multiple different problems.<br/>*Examples: [Simulated Annealing](genetic/simulated-annealing.md)*
- [Greedy algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/greedy_algorithm): select the best result at each iteration, so the global optimum is obtained by repeatedly selecting the local optimum.<br/>*Examples: [Nearest Neighbour](graph/nearest-neighbour.md), [Kruskal](graph/kruskal.md), [Prim](graph/prim.md), [Dijkstra](graph/dijkstra.md)*
