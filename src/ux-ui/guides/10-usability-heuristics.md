# 10 Usability Heuristics

The [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) are rules of thumb for user interface design, by [Jakob Nielsen](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/jakob_nielsen_(usability_consultant)).

1. **[Visibility of system status](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/)**
	Give feedback to user about what’s going on.
    *Examples: loading icon, “you are here” pin on a map, …*

2. **[Match between system and the real world](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/match-system-real-world/)**
    Design should be the same language as the user. Be careful with differences between context, cultures, backgrounds, etc. See: [Affordance](../glossary/affordance.md).
    *Examples: thumb-up button to like content, door knob design to push or pull, …*

3. **[User control and freedom](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-control-and-freedom/)**
    User makes mistakes and should be able to correct them.
    *Examples: redo an action, exit a page, …*

4. **[Consistency and standards](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/)**
    Follow established codes and conventions.
    *Example: three bars icon for a menu, underline links, …*

5. **[Error prevention](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/)**
	Avoid error-prone situations, check them, help user fix them.
    *Examples: annotate required fields in forms, warning lights in car, …*
    - Slip: unconscious errors caused by inattention.
    - Mistakes: conscious errors based on a mismatch between user and interface.

6. **[Recognition rather than recall](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/)**
    Minimize user’s memory load.    
    *Examples: label on form’s fields, progress bars, …*

7. **[Flexibility and efficiency of use](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flexibility-efficiency-heuristic/)**
    Help expert users with shortcuts, but avoid overwhelming newcomers.
    *Examples: keyboard shortcuts, gesture on touchscreens, …*

8. **[Aesthetic and minimalist design](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/aesthetic-and-minimalist-design/)**
    Avoid irrelevant information, favor element that prioritize user’s goal

9. **[Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/usability-heuristic-recognize-errors/)**
    Error message should be clear, indicate the problem, and suggest solutions.

10. **[Help and documentation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/help-and-documentation/)**
    It’s best when a system doesn’t need extra information, but it’s sometime necessary to provide additional documentation to help users.
