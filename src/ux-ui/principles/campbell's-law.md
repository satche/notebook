# Campbell's law

[Campbell's law](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/campbell%27s_law) state that hen people rely a lot on numbers to make decisions, those numbers can become vulnerable to corruption and might actually make things worse instead of better. 

> The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.

Other rules are similar to Campbell's law, like [Goodhart's law](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/goodhart%27s_law) or the [cobra effect](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/perverse_incentive#the_original_cobra_effect). This story illustrates how the government offered a bounty for every dead cobra to reduce their population. However, people began breeding more cobras to claim the rewards. When the government ended the program, breeders released the bred cobras into the country, causing the population to grow.
