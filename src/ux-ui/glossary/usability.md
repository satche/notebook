# Usability

[Usability](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/usability) is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use.

It is defined by **3 main quality components**:

- **Effectiveness**: Perform task without error, reach objective
- **Efficiency**: Time to perform tasks, with minimal effort
- **Satisfaction**: How pleasant is it to use the design

Sometimes, *effectiveness* is detailed into 3 other components:

- **Learnability**: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design ?
- **Memorability**: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency ?
- **Errors**: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from them ?

Sometimes, we trade *learnability*, *memorability* and *errors* to another quality component: **effectiveness**
