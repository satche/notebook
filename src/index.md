# What is this ?

This is my personal notebook, where I gather notes, ideas, inspirations, and resources I've collected over time. It mainly focuses on computer science and engineering. I use it to track my learning and quickly revisit concepts I've encountered. The notes are concise and to the point, often including sources and references for further exploration.

# Who are you ?

I'm Thomas, aka Satche. I initially worked as a web developer. I went back to studies to get my Bachelor degree in Media Engineering. I'm currently finishing my Master degree in Computer Science. I'm particularly interested in machine learning, creative coding, game design and development.

# Can I contribute ?

Yes, of course! It could happen that some notes are incomplete or even wrong, and if you find something that could be improved, please let me know. You can always suggest a change at the end of each page. Don't hesitate to also suggest new topics or ideas.
