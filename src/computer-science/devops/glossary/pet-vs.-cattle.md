# Pet vs. Cattle

Pets vs. Cattle is a famous analogy for infrastructure and server management.

## Pets

Each system is treated individually and considered unique, with specific configuration and manual maintenance. It offers high control, personalization, and flexibility, but is expensive.

Examples: physical server, [Virtual Machines](../virtualization.md#virtual-machines)

## Cattle

Systems are considered as interchangeable groups. Configuration is standardized and maintenance is automated. It offers high scalability and availability at a low cost, but lacks standardization, flexibility, and control.

Examples: [Containerization](../virtualization.md#containerization)
