# Graph

A [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) is a set of *vertices* (points) connected by *edges* (lines).

We use specifics [graph algorithms](../../algorithms/graph/index.md) to efficiency resolve related problems.

## Types

### Directed vs. undirected

### Eulerian vs. Hamiltonian

- [Eulerian path](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path): a path that visits each edge of the graph only once
- [Hamiltonian path](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path): a path that contains each vertex only once (e.g. [Traveling Salesman](../../algorithms/problems/traveling-salesman.md))
