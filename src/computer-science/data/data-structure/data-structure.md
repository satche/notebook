# Data structure

[Data structure](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) state how to organise and manage the data, trying to be as efficient as possible depending of the task. For example, we'll use a certain data structure that will be designed to quickly build a list, but we'll use another one for quick access to elements.
