# Algorithms

## Terminology

- [Heuristic](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/heuristic_(computer_science)): give a quick solution but usually not optimal
- [Greedy algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/greedy_algorithm): select the best result at each iteration, so the global optimum is obtained by repeatedly selecting the local optimum.
	*Examples: [Nearest Neighbour](graph/nearest-neighbour.md), [Kruskal](graph/kruskal.md), Prim, Djikstra*
