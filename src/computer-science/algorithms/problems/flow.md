# Flow cost problem

We try to find the [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem) or [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem) flow among a [graph](../../data/database/nosql/graph.md).

## Problem variations

 - The [shortest path](shortest-path.md) problem is close-related to minimal flow cost.
 - A flow cost problem can also be transformed into an [assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem)
