# Traveling Salesman Problen

The [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/travelling_salesman_problem) (TSM) needs to find the shortest possible route for a salesman to visit each city exactly one time and returns to the starting point.

It is easily transposable as a [graph](../../data/datastructure/graph.md), where cities are vertices and routes are edges, representing a [hamiltonian path](../../data/datastructure/graph.md#Eulerian%20vs.%20Hamiltonian).
