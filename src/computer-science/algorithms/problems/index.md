## Millennium Prize Problems

There is seven well-known complex mathematical problems that are called the [Millennium Prize Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems).

- [Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture "Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture")
- [Hodge conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_conjecture "Hodge conjecture")
- [Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness "Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness")
- [P vs. NP problem](p-vs-np.md)
- [Riemann hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis "Riemann hypothesis")
- [Yang–Mills existence and mass gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_existence_and_mass_gap "Yang–Mills existence and mass gap")
- [Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Poincaré conjecture")


The first correct solution of those problems are rewarded 1 million US$ by the [Clay Mathematics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Mathematics_Institute). None has been solved for now, except for the Poincaré conjecture.
