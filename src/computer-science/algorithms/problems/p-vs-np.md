# P vs. NP problem

The [P vs. NP problem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/p_versus_np_problem) asks is it's possible to finding a solution to a problem as quickly it is to verify it.

*P* and *NP* refers to the [complexity classes](../complexity.md#Complexity%20classes) of these problems. Check it to have an insight of what it refers to.

It is one of the seven [Millennium Prize Problems](./index.md#Millennium%20Prize%20Problems).

**The question**
Does every problem that can be quickly checked (NP) can also be quickly solved (P) ?
If you can efficiently *verify* an answer, can you also efficiently *find* the answer in the first place?

**The answer**
We don't know the answer yet. There is 2 possible scenarios.

$P=NP$
It means that problems for which we can quickly check solutions can also be quickly solved

$P â‰  NP$
It means there are problems where checking solutions is easy, but finding solutions is inherently harder.
