# Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

[Ford-Fulkerson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm) is a [greedy](../algorithms.md#Terminology) algorithm to find a [maximum flow](../problems/flow.md) among a [graph](../../data/database/nosql/graph.md).

## Complexity

[Time complexity](../complexity.md) for this algorithm is $O(Ef)$
- $E$ is the number of edges
- $f$ is the maximum flow in the graph
