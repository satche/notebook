# Communication diagram

A [communication diagram](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/communication_diagram) displays interactions between objects in sequence, where actions are numerated to explain the execution order.

It's very close as a [sequence diagram](sequence-diagram.md), but illustrate to have an overview of the objects rather than a timeline fashion.
