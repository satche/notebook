# Lehman's laws

[Lehman's laws](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/lehman%27s_laws_of_software_evolution) are rule of thumb that apply to software evolution.

1. **Continuing Change**: a system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory.
2. **Increasing Complexity**: as a system evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it.
3. **Self Regulation**: the more a system evolve, the less stakeholders can decide of its future.
4. **Conservation of Organisational Stability**: operational/management teams don't have influence on how fast a system evolve.
5. **Conservation of Familiarity**: releases' value of a system stay statistically the same (even if you increase operations)
6. **Continuing Growth**: the functional content of a system must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime.
7. **Declining Quality**: the quality of a system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes.
8. **Feedback System**: processes to evolve a system are complex and shouldn't be force to changes
