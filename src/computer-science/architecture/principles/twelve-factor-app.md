# Twelve-Factor App

[Twelve-Factor App](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/twelve-factor_app_methodology) is a methodology and a set of best practices to build [SaaS](../../infrastructure/cloud/as-a-service.md) applications.

1. **Codebase** – One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
2. **Dependencies** – Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. **Config** – Store config in the environment
4. **Backing services** – Treat backing services as attached resources
5. **Build, release, run** – Strictly separate build and run stages
6. **Processes** – Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
7. **Port binding** – Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency** – Scale out via the process model
9. **Disposability** – Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/prod parity** – Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
11. **Logs** – Treat logs as event streams
12. **Admin processes** – Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
