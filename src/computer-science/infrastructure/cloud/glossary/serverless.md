# Serverless

[Serverless computing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/serverless_computing) is a cloud computing model in which user can build and run application without requiring server management. The cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically handle the allocation of machine resources: storage, CPU, RAM, etc.

However, the term *serverless* is a [misnomer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/misnomer): developers still access to servers to run their code, but they just donâ€™t have to manage them, like system configuration or maintenance.

It is well-suited for short-running, [stateless](../../network/protocols.md#stateless-/-stateful) and event-driven applications *e.g. microservices, bots, IoT, service integration, etc.*
