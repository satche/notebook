# Ergonomy

[Ergonomy](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/human_factors_and_ergonomics) is the field of study focusing on the interaction between human and a system's components. It intends to maximize productivity by reducing operator fatigue and discomfort.

Compared to [usability](usability.md), *ergonomics* has a broader scope, as it takes into consideration users' physical, cognitive, and emotional factors.
