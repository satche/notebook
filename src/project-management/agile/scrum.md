# Scrum

[Scrum](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/scrum_(software_development)) is an [Agile](index.md) framework designed for small teams (10 or less). Small pieces of work are delivered frequently, at each sprints.

## Values

**Trust** is a key element which must be inherent to the team. Trust is built on three main values: **Transparency**, **Inspection** and **Adaptation**.

5 additional values is apply to the team members while working together:

- **Courage** to do the right think and work on tough problems
- **Focus** on the backlog and the objectives
- **Commitment** to achieving the defined tasks and goals
- **Respect** and trust in the capabilities of each other
- **Openness** and being transparent about work and challenges

## Workflow

- **Product backlog**: requirements for the final product.
- **Sprint planning**: organise incoming sprint (~8h for a 4-weeks sprint).
- **Sprint backlog**: requirements for the current sprint. Usually (but not necessary) made of [User Stories](index.md#user-story)
- **Daily Scrum**: a 15 minutes daily meeting
- **Increment**: actual functional state of the product
- **Sprint Review**: end-sprint meeting, involving Product Owner and stakeholders
- **Sprint Retrospective**: end-sprint meeting, only involving the [Scrum Team](#scrum-team).

### Daily Scrum

- A 15 minutes daily meeting
- Also known as Stand-up meeting, so it forces to keep it short
- Same place, same time (morning is better)
- Typically contains 3 key questions:
	- What has been done yesterday
	- What's today's goals
	- What are the blocking points
- Avoid discussion about planification, organisation, management, problem resolution, etc.
