# Not Invented Here

[Not invented here](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/not_invented_here), also known as *NIH syndrome*, is the tendency to avoid product, services or information that come from the outside.

In computer science, people with the NIH philosophy tend to do everything in-house to have more control, enhance security, and avoid additional costs.
