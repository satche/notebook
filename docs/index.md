# Welcome

## What is this ?

This is my notebook. Here, you'll find personal notes, thoughts, inspirations and other resources I've been collecting over the years. It all gravitates around computer science and engineering.

I use it to keep track of what I learn and to quickly access concepts I've overlooked. Notes are concises and to the point. They often contain sources and references to dig deeper.

## Who are you ?

I'm Thomas, aka Satche. I initially worked as a web developer. I went back to studies to get my Bachelor degree in Media Engineering. I'm currently finishing my Master degree in Computer Science.

I'm particularly interested in machine learning, creative coding, game design and development.

## Can I contribute ?

Yes, of course! It could happen that some notes are incomplete or even wrong, and if you find something that could be improved, please let me know. You can always suggest a change at the end of each page. Don't hesitate to also suggest new topics or ideas through the [Github page](https://github.com/satche/notebook).
