# Eisenhower matrix

The [Eisenhower matrix](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/time_management#the_eisenhower_method) manage tasks in 4 quadrants, classifying them by degree of importance and urgence.

1. **Important and Urgent**: tasks are done immediately and personally (e.g. crises, deadlines, problems)
2. **Important and Not Urgent**: tasks get an end date and are done personally (e.g. relationships, planning, recreation).
3. **Unimportant and Urgent**: tasks are delegated (e.g. interruptions, meetings, activities).
4. **Unimportant and Not Urgent**: tasks are dropped (e.g. time wasters, pleasant activities, trivia).
