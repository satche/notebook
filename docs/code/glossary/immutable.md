# Immutable

An [immutable](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/immutable_object) property is an object or attribute whose value cannot be changed once it has been set. This can be helpful in programming, as it ensures that the value remains consistent and cannot be modified. Immutable objects are also beneficial in terms of memory management, as they can be reused without having to be recreated each time.
