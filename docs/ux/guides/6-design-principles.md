# 6 Design Principles

By [Don Norman](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/don_norman)

1. **Visibility**
   The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to do next.

2. **Feedback**
   Sending back information about what action has been done and what to do to continue the activity.

3. **Constraints**
   Restrict user interaction at certain moments.

4. **Mapping**
   Relationship between the control and what effect/action it creates.

5. **Consistency**
   The use of similar elements to achieve similar tasks.

6. **[Affordance](../glossary/affordance.md)**
   Ability of an element to make its usage explicit.
