# Client-server

The [clientâ€“server](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/client%e2%80%93server_model) architecture style separate workload between 2 layers: the provider of a resource or service (server) and the requester (client).

Usually, client handle the front-end domain (i.e user interface) and server the back-end (processing, database, etc.). It usually follows a basic [request-response](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/request%e2%80%93response) communication.
