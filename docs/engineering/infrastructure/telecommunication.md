# Telecommunication

[Telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications) is the transmission of signals (i.e. data) over a long distance for the purpose of communication.

## Multiplexing

Sometimes, data coming from different sources still need to go through the same physical cable. To allow that, we can combine different signals into one: it's called [multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing). The single signal is then *demultiplexed* into the original ones and send to their respective destinations.

There is different ways to multiplex signals. Let's take human communication as an example.
- **Space-division**: Each channel can use its own part of the space exclusively. If people talking together are far apart from each other, the conversations won't interfere.
- **Frequency-division**: Different channels use the different frequencies. If bat and humans talk in the same time, the conversations won't interfere.
- **Time-divison**: Different channels use different time slots. People don't interfere with each other if they don't talk in the same time
- **Code division**: When signals are encrypted, they are not coded the same. People speaking different languages don't interfere.

## Transatlantic cables

To pass data from a continent to another, we use [submarine transatlantic cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable). It began around 1860 with telegraph cables, then coaxial cables in mid 20th century. Now, every cable has amplified optical fiber.

Some typical underseas cable properties:
- **Length**: can reach over 8000 km
- **Fiber optical**: around 20 pairs
- **Capacity**: aournd 500 Terabits per second (about 15'500 movie every second).
- **Multiplexing**: wavelength division (i.e. colors of light)
- **Material**: multiple layers
	- Steel wire for mechanical
	- Copper tubing for power conduction
	- Polyethylene insulation for water proofing
	- â€¦etc.
- **Maintenance**: about 100 cable faults per year (mostly due to human actions)
