<!-- TODO
- Change AI for ML → because AI is too large (?) e.g. ai in video games
- Clustering
	- K-mean
	- DBSCAN
- Classification
	- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	- Bayesian classifier
- AlphaFold
	- AlphaFold 2 (Nov 2020) predicts the 3D structure of a protein from an amino acid sequence using reinforcement learning. DeepMind developed this solution in four years, by adapting AlphaGo, the algorithm that defeated the best human player of Go in 2016
	- DeepMind has published about 200 million protein 3D structure predictions since then. Before that, there were about 100’000 known 3D structures as the result of 50 years of research

# Artificial Intelligence

[Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI) is the ability of a program or machine to think and learn by itself. One of the main field of AI is [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

## What's "intelligence" ?

There is no clear definition of what's intelligent and what's not. For example, what can we consider as intelligent in biological life ? If humans are intelligent, what about, animals, plants or even unicellular organisms…? It's a bit the same for machines. Is a calculator intelligent compared to computers or complex programs ?

There is many way to answer the question. A famous one is the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). If users interact with a program but think it's a human, it passes the test.

## ELIZA Effect

The [ELIZA effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect) describe how people tend to attribute human traits to intelligent systems that have a textual interface (typically with [LLMs](nlp/nlp.md)). Because of that, users empathise with AI system, from being polite to building friendship with.
