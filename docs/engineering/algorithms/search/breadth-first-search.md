# Breadth-first search

[Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) (BFS) search inside a [graph](../../data/database/nosql/graph.md) by first prioritising all the children nodes before moving to the next one.

## Complexity

[Time complexity](../complexity.md)
- **Worst-case**: $O(|V|+|E|)$
- **Best-case**: $\Omega(1)$
